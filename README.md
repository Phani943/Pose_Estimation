# Multi-Person Pose Estimation using Streamlit and MediaPipe

This project demonstrates multi-person pose estimation using TensorFlow, MediaPipe, and Streamlit. It allows you to upload images or videos to detect persons and visualize their pose landmarks.

## Features

- Upload an image (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) or a video file (.mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv)
- Detect persons in the uploaded media using TensorFlow object detection
- Visualize pose landmarks on detected persons using MediaPipe
- Option to draw bounding boxes around detected persons
- Demo mode to display pose estimation on a pre-defined image
